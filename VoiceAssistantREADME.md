The code represents a basic voice assistant implemented in Python. The voice assistant can recognize voice commands, perform tasks such as fetching weather information and searching Wikipedia, and respond audibly to the user's commands.

Modules and Libraries Used:
speech_recognition: Used for speech recognition, allowing the assistant to understand spoken commands.
pyttsx3: Utilized for text-to-speech conversion, enabling the assistant to respond audibly to the user.
requests: Employed for making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather information.
wikipedia: Used for searching and retrieving summaries from Wikipedia.
Functions:
listen():

Purpose: Listens to the user's voice input through the microphone.
Returns: The recognized speech as text.
speak(text):

Purpose: Converts text to speech and outputs it through the system's audio output.
Parameters:
text: The text to be spoken by the assistant.
get_weather(city):

Purpose: Fetches weather information for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
Parameters:
city: The name of the city for which weather information is requested.
Returns: A string containing the weather information for the specified city.
search_wikipedia(query):

Purpose: Searches for a query on Wikipedia and retrieves a summary of the corresponding page.
Parameters:
query: The search query for which a summary is requested.
Returns: A summary of the Wikipedia page corresponding to the search query.
main():

Purpose: The main function that handles the interaction with the voice assistant.
Functionality:
Greets the user and prompts for commands.
Listens for user commands.
If the command includes "weather", prompts for the city and fetches weather information.
If the command includes "Wikipedia", prompts for the search query and retrieves a summary from Wikipedia.
If the command includes "goodbye", terminates the program.
Otherwise, informs the user that the command was not understood.
Execution:
The main() function is executed when the script is run.
The assistant greets the user and listens for commands indefinitely until the user says "goodbye".
